# API Data Fetch and Export Application

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Update `config.properties` with your API credentials.
4. Modify the API payload in `main.py` with requested information
5. Run the application:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Project Overview
This application fetches data from an API, stores it in SQLite, and exports it as CSV, Excel, or PDF.

## Architecture
- `config/config.properties` - Stores API credentials.
- `src/main.py` - Runs the application.
- `src/config_handler.py` - Reads credentials from the configuration file.
- `src/functions_auto.py` - Contains API requests, SQLite operations, and export functions.
- `output/{year}/{month}/{day}/{fileName}` - Contains the Output files generated by the application

## API Request
- HTTP Method: POST
- Authorization: Basic Auth
- Payload:
  ```json
  {
      "data": {
          "hostHeaderInfo": {
              "affiliateCode": "Your Affiliate",
              "departmentName": "Your Department Name",
              "requester": "Your Name",
              "startDate": "2025-03-01",
              "startDate": "2025-03-31"
          }
      }
  }

## How It Works
- The application reads API credentials from config.properties.
- Sends a POST request with the predefined payload.
- Stores the API response in a temporary SQLite database table.
- Generates an Excel File.

## Running the Application
```bash
python main.py
```
